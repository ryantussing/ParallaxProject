/*
NEXT STEP:
work on creating javascript that will allow me to make a scrolling effect. i think after that i will work on adding
new elements, like div's in the body to hold text, but i can see that not working due to my lack of knowledge.

currently i am stuck between the css non-adaptive animation and the javascript adaptive animation. in theory, the 
css animation i have programmed above will do the animation once and return it to its original state afterwards. the 
js animation is what i really want to work. the css is basically a test for function. however, that's not working.
and neither is the js. i need to make sure scrollY outputs in js so that i know it's at least moving. and then 
figure what's up with the css if i need to
